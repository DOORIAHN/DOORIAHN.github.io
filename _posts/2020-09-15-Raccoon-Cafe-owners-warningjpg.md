What are you doing to catch and raise animals... Please watch animals in nature on TV with your own eyes. So is the person who runs a cafe. The news came out before, and all raccoons are dying. Some places that went out of business were left there to starve all raccoons.

@ㅂㅂㅂㅂㅂㅂㅇㅇㅇ If you are well cared for, I think the zoo is better than the wild wild. We also like chicken coop apartments. If the wild is good, living in an outdoor cave or hut. Where will you be happy?
