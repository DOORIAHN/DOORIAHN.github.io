They have already been well trained since they can walk 4 animals simultaneously.

The dog is nice and the owner is nice

@ㅇㅁㅇ/ Usually, when you walk around with a dog, you're just approaching, so from the point of view of the dog, it wasn't really trying to beat it, but a little bit of affection? People who don’t have dogs often get scared from the moment they open their mouths, so if they’re big dogs, they’re not going to go to people. Even if it’s the giver, it’s because we have to hold it so that we cannot get close.

It is a neighborhood with a house and an apartment, but instead of a muzzle for a large dog, I untie the leash and give birth. The dog ran and ran and followed, but I wanted to get excited, so I couldn’t run away and freeze while I was walking, but the owner or something was froze. Collar. No, if you want to play, go to the dog playground or...
