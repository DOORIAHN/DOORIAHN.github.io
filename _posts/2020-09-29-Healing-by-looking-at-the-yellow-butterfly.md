A yellow butterfly came to the garden where I work.

The flowers are pretty, but the butterflies are very pretty

Things that didn't come to my eyes when I was young are turning 40

Every little thing is beautiful

​

It's a really bad Monday, but finish well

Everyone, have a happy week

See also the black swallowtail butterfly, which is full of palms. Heh, three or four times the size of the morning glory in full bloom.
