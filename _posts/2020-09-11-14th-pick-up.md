I found a sick cat on my way to work, but I couldn't rescue myself and go to work.

On the way home from work, I searched all over the place!!!

Hospital admission

There was no improvement in hospitalization for more than a week, so I confirmed that it is peritonitis. The hospital cost so far is millions of won, and the hospital cost will be higher in the future, but I hope it will be better.

Peritonitis... My cat was also peritonitis...Tã…  It cost a little more than 10 million won... New drug is good, but it's expensive... I have a lot of liver damage right now, but it's been 6 months after treatment for peritonitis and 6 months after getting better I don't regret it.

Please do your best. I sincerely wish you a quick recovery. And I know that there are a lot of hospital bills that are not a joke.. Don't pay for it alone.

No matter how much I squeeze my hair out, I can't even follow the toes of 13 Myo 2 Nyeomam's big and compassionate heart... Wow, I hope that the wind produces good results. May everyone be happy, including the new Nyan family you uploaded!

Do you provide medical insurance for foreigners? Get dog cats or medical insurance.
