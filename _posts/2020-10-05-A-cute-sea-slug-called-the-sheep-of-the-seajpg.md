**Costaciella Kuroshmae**

**(Costasiella kuroshimae)**

​

​

It is so long that it is a mollusk of the Minsung family, commonly called leaf sheep.

They live mainly on the plants in the sea, and the chloroplasts in them can be used for photosynthesis.

With this characteristic, it has green leaves.

The two dark-colored horns on the front replace the sense of smell.

​

It mainly lives in the deep seas of Japan, the Philippines, and Indonesia.

The leaf part can be folded or unfolded freely

No matter how many leaves grow, they are very, very small creatures with a maximum of 5mm, so it is not easy to find.

​

Taiwanese photographer Lin Wu has gained attention when he released a close-up photo at the 2014 ND Awards.

(The first picture above and that picture wins)
