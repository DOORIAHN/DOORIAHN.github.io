**It was so scary that it used to be misunderstood as a wolf dog.**

**It is** **said that they rarely** **ask people because they like people very much** **.** ********

**Because of that nature, it is said that it cannot be used as a guard dog.**

**(It's still not good to touch or get close without the owner's permission, there is no dog that doesn't bite under any circumstances)**

​

**He has a strong curiosity, but it is said that the person-like personality is added to it, and it seems that he is attracted to strangers as well.**

​

**Husky's personality that only those who know husky know~**

I also thought that a husky that was tied up stared at me with a charismatic look like the picture.

@Moon Isn't it against dementia ? Although the husky is sharp and the malamute looks pure, I know the opposite personality. Rather, I know that there are more cases of accidents when approaching Malamute because of the pure appearance. The size of the inspanidual is also larger. Are you sure what you said?
