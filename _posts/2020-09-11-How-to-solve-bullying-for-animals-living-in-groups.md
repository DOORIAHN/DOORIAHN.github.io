@Aaronism In order to exclude the lead, one central point is needed, but it is not easy because the person playing the role becomes the target of the bullying lead.

@Hyu9431 The problem is not that the leader is the leader, but the people around who make that person the leader. It is up to the people around them to make a leader or deport them, but many bystanders or neighbors in Korea don't know what they're doing wrong, and only the leaders or victims frustrate.
