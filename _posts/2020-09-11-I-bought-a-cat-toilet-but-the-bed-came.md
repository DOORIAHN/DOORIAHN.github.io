There are people who misunderstand, so add it to the post!

3 cat towers, 1 tower type cat wheel, 3 stage breathing room There are many places to play, such as a cat walker.

Originally, Garfield and Bento are used by cats, so they don't know if it's a bathroom...

(If there is not enough space or psychologically unstable, there are cases where you hide in the bathroom, but there are exceptionsðŸ˜…)

Sand's name is Unicharm

Like Garfield and Bento, it wasn't sand to break 5-7cm ~

Itâ€™s 11-year-old butler. Tofu or pellet sand

I'm using Bento and Garfield because I know it can cause diseases like cystitis.

Unicharm has a favorite cat, so I bought it to test it!

In the end, I prefer the other direction, but...ðŸ˜…

why?????!!! Are the cats always plugged in or stuck in something ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ After going out of the laundry room, I felt the gaze from the line next door, so I looked at the moving country, Mr. Ko Young-hee, who is plugged into a living thing. Please show me one more time. See you.
