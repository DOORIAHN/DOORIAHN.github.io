Dog: If you pretend not to know this much, you have to come out by yourself

@₩tf No matter how good the dog smells, it seems that he can't find the owner in just one second, who just ran away with all the smells in the air hahaha. They seem to know that just because they have a good sense of smell, it can be detected in one second just like a machine..ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ A good sense of smell does not mean that even if a person moves violently, the final point is found in one second. Rather, it's good, so it's a reaction to this smell and that smell and find it late...

You can see from this filming.. It wasn't fun for the dog to go to be a princess, but it was fun for the owner to give praise and receive a ball.
