Border collie wins most of the agility competitions

(This video is a winning dog called'Fame' in 2018)

Since it is a highly active breed, it overflows with energy even in the atmosphere.

But before the start, the owner focuses on the word'stay' right away.

I'm raising a husky. Border collie knows only the owner, but husky just likes everything. People passing by, animals, flowers, butterflies, etc. They don't come well even if they call huskies. It’s because I’m optimistic and interested. Even though my face looks fierce, there hasn't been a big accident because of the husky.

Border Collie genius dog. If there is no environment in which to exude energy, that intelligence is used to crush the owner. If you become a genius devil dog, even the trainers cannot handle it.
