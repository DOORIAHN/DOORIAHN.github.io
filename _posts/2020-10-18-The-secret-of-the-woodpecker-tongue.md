I live in the United States, and he comes to my house every morning this summer. Terrible stress. . If I keep making it loud, I say that it doesn't come, so every morning I knock a can outside the house and scream ㅜㅜ Finally, after a month, I scratch my house and disappear. . .But at my neighbor's house, I'm starting to scream ㅋ҉ ㅋ҉
