If there are multiple cats, they take turns watching the child.

When the baby is crying while the mother is washing dishes or taking a shower, the cat comes to call for crying when the baby is crying.

@ Quarterly International Moon Hyung-wook Kang said that raising dogs, cats and babies together was bad. Animals are always animals. If there are 100 dangerous situations, the dangerous situation increases to 101 due to cats. From the parent's point of view, if only one thing decreases, it should be reduced, and is there a guarantee that the cat will not scratch the baby because the child is surprised by pinching or hitting the cat? There's a reason to say you're not an expert. Tea is indispensable to life, and even if you don't have a cat, there's nothing wrong with your life.. Your comparative advantage is wrong.

Yes. When a child cries while hanging the laundry on the veranda with a toy on the living room mat, or putting a jumper on it, both of them come to the veranda to look for that, and they are just anxious. Even after a good night's sleep, you can also see the baby wake up when crying hahaha
