In the US or Europe, if you have a lot of kids, government subsidies come out a lot. It doesn't cost much for education like we do, so it's enough to raise the kids. I don't know the exact calculation method, but I remember that in the past, in the United States, if there are 6 children, about 6~7 million won in our money comes out as a subsidy. Whatever the parents, if they have a job, raising children is not a big problem.
