Our pumpkin~♡ I'm 9 years old and I'm gentle and timid Oh my, what is this paper? Heh. Everyone is surprised when they say Sichu. I'm already 9 years old. I want to be with you all my life.

Not at all ㅠ Eun-geun is stubborn. Once picked up, it's like the truth and it's iron plated and pushed in with a mortar, or it never gets out of bed like the photo. Jim Sichu is the first and the second is the same. Timid, no barking, gentle and hungry. They are both organic dogs, so they need to lose weight.

It is cancerous if you give feed counting since childhood to grow small drilling. He's a kid with so much food.. If he doesn't give food because he wants to eat it...

I was excited, so I put my hand on my neck.
