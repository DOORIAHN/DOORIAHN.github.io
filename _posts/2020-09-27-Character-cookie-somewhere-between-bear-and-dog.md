Everyone, the synchronization of the brain and hand is so difficult.

This is the second character cookie I tried, but it was still finished without my identity. I don't know if it's a bear or an individual, but it's fun to make, and of course, the taste is guaranteed.

It contains plenty of almond powder.

​

<Ingredients> Salted butter 130g Soft flour 200g Almond powder 40g 1 yolk

Sugar 100g Cocoa powder 5g Green tea powder 5g Wilton pigment black, white

​

Whisk the butter at room temperature with a whipper, mix it with sugar to make it white, and cream with the yolk. Sift the soft flour and clump it to the extent that the powder is invisible. Divide the dough to be colored from the beginning, add the subsidiary powder, mix each, wrap it in plastic, and leave to refrigerate for 30 minutes.

After shaping it into a predetermined character shape, put it in the freezer for about 50 minutes, take it out, cut it with a knife, and bake it in a preheated oven at 175 degrees for 15 minutes.

The guy born on the second attempt

It's the first guy who tried it, and someone said it.

I don’t know who you are in Yo-Kai Watch.

It's cruel why I keep splitting it in half (I'm not angry or I want to eat it...)
