The puppy in the picture was happy. It's a difficult time to pass through every year as you grow up.

Then one summer day, my father pulls us out saying that we are going for a walk. Some of my father's friends in the neighborhood climbed the mountain in the back. If you would like to cook in the mountain, you bring a pot pot and a spoon. Eat a lot of Baeksuk ^^

Our maternal grandmother raised yellow and albino dogs, and we had fun with puppies. One day, my maternal grandmother said that she sold the puppies to Gaejangsu. It didn't seem that expensive. And I am now living as a vegetarian.
