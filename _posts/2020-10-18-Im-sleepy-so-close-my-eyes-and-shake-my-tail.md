It seems like I close my eyes to ask for a stroke...

-Are you happy?? Jeolla-do skater is a reality lol ㅋㅋㅋ Even a 3-year-old kid knows that Jeolla-do was used as an exile area for prisoners in the past.

-Are you happy?? If you have common sense, you should think about it ㅋㅋㅋ Most of the prisoners who return home for a few months or a few decades have been sent to Jeolla Province, but it seems that how many of them have settled in Jeolla Province, and a few have returned to Hanyang or Kaesong again. Looks like? Just think about it, idiot
