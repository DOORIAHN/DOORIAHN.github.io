I made it fun to edit, but in the end it's a picture where two dogs attack a cat, but I'm the only one that's uncomfortable?

The cat seems to be advantageous in a 2v1 situation, but it is a fatal injury unless it runs away. Especially large dogs think of small animals as toys. Grandmother's dog Yorkshire terrier, who had been drinking with her grandmother, died from being bitten. She died from being bitten by her grandmother's dog, Danmochiwa. Both were obedient, so my father sued. I released a big dog and raised it. Wool Grandmother raised Doberman since then. Ask them to bite and kill the big dogs... Ulhalmi is really charismatic. You're the best of uber. Originally she was gentle...

The film I saw 17 years ago is still me... Stop worrying because the babies they gave birth to are already old and dead.
