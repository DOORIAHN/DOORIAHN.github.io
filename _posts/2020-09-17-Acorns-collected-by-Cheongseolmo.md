Squirrels eat only open acorns on the tree. They donâ€™t eat anything that fell to the ground, but hide them on the ground. However, they do not eat acorns that have been hidden once and forget them, so if the hidden acorns are planted well, it becomes a tree.

@Olf And when those acorns grow in a tree... That tree suffers from the trees that grow and then asks you to kill me, right?
